# kmeans

**kmeans.py** is a python script facilitating the usage of the [k-means Clustering algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering).

**normvec.py** is a python script with the purpose to facilitate normalizing the vectors used by kmeans.py.

## But why?

I wanted to cluster some data quickly.

## Usage

```
./kmeans.py [filename]

./normvec.py [input file] [output file]
```
